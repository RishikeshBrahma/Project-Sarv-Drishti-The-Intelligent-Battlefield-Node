# Project-Sarv-Drishti-The-Intelligent-Battlefield-Node
Sarv-Drishti is the intelligent, integrating layer designed to bridge the gap between high-level command systems and the soldier on the ground. This project aims to develop a holistic digital ecosystem that serves as a real-time, AI-powered information hub for frontline personnel.
It combines a sophisticated backend for automated threat analysis with a user-friendly, soldier-centric frontend for tactical support. This two-part system is engineered to automate detection and simplify decision-making, ensuring our soldiers have immediate access to critical intelligence.

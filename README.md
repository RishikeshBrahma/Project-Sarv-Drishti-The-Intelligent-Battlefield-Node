Project Sarv-Drishti: The Intelligent Battlefield Node
Harnessing AI to Create a Decisive Edge for the Indian Soldiers
The Current Landscape: Powerful but Disconnected

The Indian Armed Forces possess excellent modern technology, but a critical gap exists.

Command Systems:

Akashteer and the IAF's IACCS (Integrated Air Command and Control System) provide high-level control and strategic oversight.

Sensors:

Arudhra & Ashwini radars offer excellent ground-based surveillance, detecting airborne threats and movements.

Airborne Assets:

Netra AEW&C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) provides a crucial "eye in the sky" for extensive aerial reconnaissance.

Navigation:

NavIC, Indiaâ€™s own navigation system, ensures precise positioning and timing for all operations.

The Challenge:

How do we deliver critical, actionable data from these powerful systems to the individual soldier in real-time, without creating a "human-delay loop" that hampers rapid decision-making?


Project Sarv-Drishti: The Intelligent Battlefield Node

Sarv-Drishti is the intelligent, integrating layer designed to bridge the gap between high-level command systems and the soldier on the ground. This project aims to develop a holistic digital ecosystem that serves as a real-time, AI-powered information hub for frontline personnel.

It combines a sophisticated backend for automated threat analysis with a user-friendly, soldier-centric frontend for tactical support. This two-part system is engineered to automate detection and simplify decision-making, ensuring our soldiers have immediate access to critical intelligence.


The Core Idea: A Refined Two-Part System

Part 1: The "Drishti" AI Engine  (The Detector)

This is a pure AI/ML threat detection and scoring module. Built on Python using powerful libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch for object detection and pattern recognition, its sole purpose is to analyse vast amounts of data from multiple sources. It identifies potential threats and assigns a calculated "Probability of Threat" score.

Part 2: The "Sahayak" Node  (The Display)

This is the soldier's tactical UI/UX interface. It receives the simplified output from "Drishti" (e.g., "Threat Type: Aircraft, Score: 95%") and displays it clearly. It can suggest incoming threats and provides a one-touch communication system for streamlined reporting, giving every soldier a better overview of the battlefield.

This modular design ensures high performance and focused functionality, allowing for future upgrades and seamless integration with evolving military technologies.

Key Technologies Used

Backend: "Drishti" AI Engine

Language: Python, the industry standard for AI development.

Core Libraries: TensorFlow and PyTorch, robust frameworks for deep learning and neural networks, enabling sophisticated object detection and pattern recognition.

Specialized Libraries: OpenCV for real-time image and video analysis, alongside custom libraries for efficient processing of diverse satellite and radar data feeds.

Frontend: "Sahayak" Battlefield Node

Application Framework: Upon detecting a threat, the Drishti AI seamlessly sends data via a secure Django backend and API to the soldier's ruggedised web-based device, ensuring instant display of critical alerts and tactical information.

User Experience: Designed for minimal cognitive load in high-stress environments, with clear visual cues and intuitive controls for immediate comprehension and action.

This robust technological stack ensures reliability, scalability, and the ability to process vast amounts of data in real-time, critical for battlefield applications.


Future Scope

Project Sarv-Drishti is designed with scalability and future expansion in mind, with several key areas identified for advanced development:

Full Hardware Integration:

Directly connect with real-time sensor feeds from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and soldier-worn devices like smart glasses or body cameras for truly immersive situational awareness.

Advanced AI Modules:

Expand the AI's capabilities to predict enemy movements based on historical patterns, suggest optimal patrol routes considering terrain and threat assessments, and autonomously manage logistics for resource optimisation.

Inter-Service Network:

Create a unified, encrypted data grid where Army, Navy, and Air Force nodes can share real-time intelligence seamlessly, fostering true joint operations capability and integrated command.

Autonomous Actions:

Explore authorised, AI-assisted engagement protocols for identified threats, drastically shortening reaction times in critical scenarios while maintaining human oversight and ethical considerations.

These advancements will ensure Sarv-Drishti remains at the cutting edge of military technology, continuously enhancing the operational effectiveness of the Indian Armed Forces.

Conclusion

Project Sarv-Drishti represents a significant leap forward in military intelligence and operational efficiency. By leveraging cutting-edge AI/ML technologies, we can achieve unparalleled levels of battlefield awareness.

Automate Threat Detection

with incredible accuracy and speed, reducing human error and cognitive load.

Provide Unprecedented Situational Awareness

to every soldier, transforming individual combat effectiveness.

Forge a Smarter, Faster, and More Lethal Fighting Force.

This is the essential next step in building a truly digital and intelligent Indian Armed Forces.

Project Sarv-Drishti is not about replacing our current systems; it's about unlocking their full potential. By providing AI-powered clarity and immediate intelligence, we empower our soldiers to be Smarter, Faster, and Safer on the modern battlefield.
